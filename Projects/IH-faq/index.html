              Car insurance helps you to recover from damage, injuries and expenses related to a collision or other incident. It is not designed for you to come
              out ahead financially, but it is designed to keep you from suffering major financial hardship due to an accident, whether it’s your fault or not.
              <br />
              Car insurance is about risk transfer. If you don’t have insurance, the financial risk is on you in the event of an accident. Buying auto insurance
              mitigates some of that risk. For the cost of your premium, the insurance company will take on much of that risk for you.

              Forty-seven states require vehicles to have some level of insurance coverage before they can be on the road. Failure to have insurance can mean a
              fine and/or jail time in these states, not to mention suspension or revocation of your driver’s license. In most of those states, the minimum
              required coverage is liability insurance to cover damage and injuries you may cause, though a handful of states require additional coverage, such
              as collision and comprehensive.

              If you are self-employed and use your personal vehicle for business, you can take a tax deduction for your car insurance. For example, an
              independent sales professional who travels for work can take the deduction. However, only the actual mileage used for business travel is
              deductible. In other words, if you drive a vehicle 15,000 miles for business and 15,000 for personal use (a total of 30,000 miles annually) your
              deduction will cover half of your overall use.

              If your car is stolen, a number of things need to happen for you to be compensated for your loss. First, you will need to file a police report and
              wait while there is an attempt at recovery. If your car is not recovered, you can file a claim with your insurance company if you have
              comprehensive coverage.
              <br />
              Because of the risk insurance companies face with fraudulent claims, you will need to complete some paperwork to file your claim. But providing
              you have documentation for the stolen vehicle, your insurance will compensate you for the value of the vehicle up to the limit of your
              comprehensive coverage.

              This is a common question. If you make sure you have your own vehicle covered, do you need to get the special coverage offered at the rental
              counter if you go on vacation and get a rental car?
              <br />
              You will have to double-check your particular policy, but most policies do provide the same coverage for a rental car that you have for your
              personal vehicle, unless the rental is being used for business purposes. It’s always a good idea to check your policy.

              It used to be the case that you could easily cross the border into Mexico without any special type of insurance. That’s no longer the case.
              Mexican authorities now require proof of financial responsibility in case you have an accident during your stay in Mexico. You’ll need to buy
              international car insurance, even to cross the border to Mexico, carrying at least the minimum liability coverage.
              <br />
              U.S. liability insurance is not a valid form of insurance that is recognized by Mexican law. Some U.S. insurers partner with local insurance
              carriers in Mexico and offer the coverage you should buy before you embark on your trip. If your insurer does not offer Mexican insurance, find
              the right agent because coverage is only more expensive if you buy it en route to Mexico.
