                Also if you are lucky and decide to visit during their bathing time you will be able to help scrub our Elephants down and help our care-takers bathe them; but you can get yourself very wet as the Elephats love a good water fight.

                <p id="activities">Location: Reptile House 1<br>Time: 1300hrs(Everday)<br> Price:Rs.1,000/= <br><br> Snakes in general are considered one of the most scary and deadly animals at first glance. Due to this misconception many people end up harming and killing snakes the second they see them and a very negative mindset has been set to our younger generation as well about snakes.<br>
                    <br> This is a very toxic misconception. No pun intended due to the fact that not all snakes are venomous and if we continue killing snakes without protecting them our country would be rundown by rodents and other pesky animals and also snakes are generally very non confrontational animals who only harm humans when they feel threatened.<br>
                    <br>Therefore, we introduce our new zoo activity which is "Snakes are our friends!" where you get to get up and close with these beautiful creatures and experience them first hands. You will be able to carry our majestic pythons on your shoulders and pet them.
