            Wildlife of Sri Lanka includes its flora and fauna and their natural
            habitats. Sri Lanka has probably the most elevated rates of organic
            endemism (16% of the fauna and 23% of blooming plants are endemic)
            on the planet. Consequently, Sri Lanka takes up a great deal of
            pride to give an ideal climate to preserve and secure it's common
            fortunes. One such measure is the creation and upkeep of the
            Dehiwala Zoo<br /><br />
            The National Zoological Gardens of Sri Lanka is a zoological nursery
            arranged in Dehiwala, Sri Lanka, which was established in 1936. Its
            rambling zones are host to an assortment of creatures and birds. The
            zoo displays creatures yet in addition puts an accentuation on
            creature protection and government assistance, and training. The
            Dehiwala National Zoo, which has a striking assortment of outlandish
            and native fauna, is probably the most established zoo in Asia.
            <br />
            <br />
            At present, Dehiwala Zoo houses 72 types of Mammals, 65 types of
            Birds, 31 types of Reptiles, 89 types of Fish, 03 groups of
            Amphibians and 30 types of Butterflies and so forth The total number
            of creatures shifts from 2500-3000 because of rearing and free
            living settlements of birds. <br />

                    Lana was born on 10th September 2001 and flew down to Sri
                    Lanka all the way from Africa. She is lighter in colour and
                    weighs about 196kg. Lana loves scent-based enrichment,
                    including herbs and hessian sacks and the odd egg and fish
                    treat. Lana loves a good nap as she spends up to 20 hours of
                    the day sleeping or resting. She can be found lying on her
                    back with her feet up or taking a snooze in the shade.

                <section class="arrivals">
                  <img src="images/python.jpg" alt="Python" />
                  <p>
                    Maxy is a 25 year old male ball python donated to the zoo by
                    a private donor. Ball pythons are named after their natural
                    defensive behaviors. They tend to curl up into a ball with
                    their head toward the center of the ball when threatened.
                    With proper socialization, they can be easily handled and
                    are very docile. They are also called the “royal python”
                    because ancient royalty wore them as jewelry. No two ball
                    pythons are alike. They all have their own beautiful and
                    unique patterns. So we can safely say his spots are far
                    different from our older python "Leela" who has been with us
                    for 3 years.

                  <p>
                    Vega was a rescue Elephant who was under the care of the
                    Pinnawala Rehabillitation Elephant Sanctuary after he was
                    injured by poachers in 2016. However, he is all healed up
                    now and transfered to us where he can live safely away from
                    the harm of any poachers. He is 40 year's old and loves to
                    have long baths where he gets a nice back scrub from our
                    care takers.

                  <p>
                    Zhang was donated to us by the Chineese National Zoo and we
                    consider ourselves very lucky to have the opportunity to
                    take care of him as The White Tiger is one of the rarer
                    relatives of the big cats. He is 1.5 years old so he still
                    is relatively young so he loves his daily bottle of milk,
                    but that doesn't stop him from tearing into his lunch which
                    is an assortment of meat.

                    Last but definietly not the least we are lucky to now home
                    Seetha the rare Albino Indian Cobra. Albino cobras are among
                    10 of the rarest Albino animals in the world so you can
                    imagine how honored the Dehiwala Zoo is to have her. Other
                    than the fact that she has Albinism she is in all sorts a
                    normal Cobra so she is a fiesty girl who loves her personal
                    space.
